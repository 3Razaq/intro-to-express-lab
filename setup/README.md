# ![Intro to Express Lab - Setup](./assets/hero.png)

## Setup 
Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/labs`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/labs
```

Make a new directory called **`intro-to-express-lab`**, then enter this directory and initialize the project:

```bash
mkdir intro-to-express-lab
cd intro-to-express-lab
touch server.js
npm init -y
npm install express
```

With the initialization completed, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

1. Define all of your code in a `server.js` file.

2. The express application should listen for requests on port 3000.
